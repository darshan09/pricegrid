## Disclosure Timeline

- Initial acknowledgement target: **within 72 hours**.
- Triage/update target: **within 7 days**.

## Scope Notes

- Dependency vulnerabilities are in-scope if they are exploitable in this project.
- Reports that only contain automated scanner output without a viable exploit path may be deprioritized.
