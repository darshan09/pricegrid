# Governance

This project follows a lightweight maintainer-led governance model.

## Roles

### Maintainers

Maintainers are responsible for:

- triaging issues and pull requests
- reviewing and merging changes
- managing releases
- enforcing the Code of Conduct
- handling coordinated security disclosures

### Contributors

Contributors can propose changes through pull requests and issues.

## Decision Making

- Normal changes are approved via maintainer review in pull requests.
- Breaking changes and policy changes should be documented in a dedicated issue/PR discussion before merge.
- In case of disagreement, maintainers make the final decision with rationale recorded in PR comments.

## Becoming a Maintainer

Active contributors who demonstrate sustained, high-quality contributions and community stewardship may be invited by existing maintainers.

## Inactive Maintainers

Maintainers who are inactive for an extended period may be moved to emeritus status by consensus of active maintainers.
